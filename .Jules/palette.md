## 2024-05-23 - Keyboard Shortcut Discoverability
**Learning:** Adding keyboard shortcuts (1-4) is invisible without cues. Adding small visual hints (`[1]`) inside the buttons significantly improves discoverability and usability without cluttering the UI on mobile (hidden via CSS).
**Action:** When adding hotkeys, always pair them with a visual indicator, responsive if possible.
